### About OECC
The first OptoElectronics and Communications Conference (OECC) was held in Chiba, Japan, 1996, as an annual conference for the researchers and engineers working in the fields of optoelectronics, optical fiber transmission, and photonic network systems in the Asia Pacific region to report, discuss, exchange, and generate ideas which advance the disciplines of optoelectronics and optical communications. Throughout the years, OECC has become the foremost international conferences held annually in the Asia-Pacific region.

OECC 2023 will be held in Shanghai during July 2-6, 2023. The conference is organized by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Zhejiang University, co-sponsored by IEEE Photonics Society, The Optical Society, The Chinese Optical Society and China Institute Communications. All presented papers will be indexed by EI compendex and available in IEEE Xplore and Optics InfoBase (Optica).
